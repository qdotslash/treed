               Turkey's health minister said Monday that the country is using a drug sent from China on patients suffering from the novel coronavirus.
              </p>
              <p>
               "From this morning we have brought a special drug used in China which is claimed to have resulted in improvements in intensive care patients, cutting their time in care from 11-12 days to four days," Fahrettin Koca told reporters.
              </p>
              <p>
               He did not give more information on the drug but the anti-malarial drug chloroquine has recently been used to treat coronavirus patients in China as well as France.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some researchers have said chloroquine shows great promise, though scientists have agreed that more trials are needed to determine if the drug is really effective and safe.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to figures released late Monday, Turkey has officially recorded 1,529 coronavirus cases and 37 deaths.
              </p>
              <p>
               Koca said 50,000 rapid detection kits had arrived from China on Monday and had begun to be used, with 300,000 expected by Thursday.
              </p>
              <p>
               The minister added that the Chinese government agreed with Turkey to share information on the novel coronavirus as the two countries step up cooperation to fight against the pandemic.
              </p>
              <p>
               While Koca did not detail where the positive cases were in Turkey, he said the virus had spread across the country.
              </p>
              <p>
               He did say there were fewer than 10 cases in Turkey's Van province, which borders badly-hit Iran.
              </p>
              <p>
               He also said some health workers had caught the coronavirus, without giving figures.
              </p>
              <p>
               A further 32,000 health workers will be employed during the crisis, he told a press conference in Ankara.
              </p>
              <p>
               Koca also said that face masks produced in Turkey "will not be exported" as the country was in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               There had been speculation that Koca might announce a state of emergency, but he urged Turks to "announce their own state of emergency" as he insisted citizens adhere to measures already announced by Ankara.
              </p>
              <p>
               Turkish authorities have ordered those aged 65 and above and those with chronic illnesses to stay at home, while most public spaces have been temporarily closed.
