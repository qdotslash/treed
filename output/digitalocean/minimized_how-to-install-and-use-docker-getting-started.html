     Whether it be from your development machine to a remote server for production, or packaging everything for use elsewhere, it is always a challenge when it comes to porting your application stack together with its dependencies and getting it to run without hiccups. In fact, the challenge is immense and solutions so far have not really proved successful for the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a nutshell, docker as a
     <em>
      project
     </em>
     offers you the complete set of higher-level tools to carry everything that forms an application across systems and machines - virtual or physical - and brings along loads more of great benefits with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Docker achieves its robust application (and therefore, process and resource) containment via
     <strong>
      <em>
       Linux Containers
      </em>
     </strong>
     (e.g. namespaces and other kernel features). Its further capabilities come from a project’s own parts and components, which extract all the complexity of working with
     <em>
      lower-level
     </em>
     linux tools/APIs used for system and application management with regards to securely containing processes.

     Docker Containers
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The entire procedure of porting applications using docker relies solely on the shipment of containers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Docker containers are basically directories which can be packed (e.g. tar-archived) like any other, then shared and run across various different machines and platforms (hosts). The only dependency is having the hosts tuned to run the containers (i.e. have docker installed). Containment here is obtained via
     <em>
      Linux Containers
     </em>
     (LXC).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      LXC (Linux Containers)
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Linux Containers can be defined as a combination various kernel-level features (i.e. things that Linux-kernel
     <em>
      can
     </em>
     do) which allow management of applications (and resources they use) contained within their own environment. By making use of certain features (e.g. namespaces, chroots, cgroups and SELinux profiles), the LXC contains application processes and helps with their management through limiting resources, not allowing reach beyond their own file-system (access to the parent’s namespace) etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Docker
     </strong>
     with its
     <em>
      containers
     </em>
     makes use of LXC, however, also brings along much more.
    </p>
    <h3 id="docker-containers">
     Docker Containers
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Docker containers have several main features.
    </p>
    <p>
     They allow;
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Application portability
     </li>
     <li>
      Isolating processes
     </li>
     <li>
      Prevention from tempering with the outside
     </li>
     <li>
      Managing resource consumption
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     and more, requiring much less resources than traditional virtual-machines used for isolated application deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
     They do
     <strong>
      not
     </strong>
     allow;
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Messing with other processes
     </li>
     <li>
      Causing “dependency hell”
     </li>
     <li>
      Or not working on a different system
     </li>
     <li>
      Being vulnerable to attacks and abuse all system’s resources
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     and (also) more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being based and depending on LXC, from a technical aspect, these containers are like a directory (but a shaped and formatted one). This allows
     <em>
      portability
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      gradual builds
     </em>
     of containers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each container is layered like an
     <em>
      onion
     </em>
     and each action taken within a container consists of putting another block (which actually translates to a simple change within the file system) on top of the previous one. And various tools and configurations make this set-up work in a harmonious way altogether (e.g. union file-system).
    </p>
    <p>
     What this way of having containers allows is the extreme benefit of easily launching and creating new containers and images, which are thus kept lightweight (thanks to gradual and layered way they are built). Since everything is based on the file-system, taking snapshots and performing roll-backs in time are
     <em>
      cheap
     </em>
     (i.e. very easily done / not heavy on resources), much like
     <em>
      version control systems
     </em>
     (VCS).
    </p>
    <p>
     Each
     <strong>
      docker container
     </strong>
     starts from a
     <strong>
      docker image
     </strong>
     which forms the base for other applications and layers to come.
    </p>
    <h3 id="docker-images">
     Docker Images
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Docker images constitute the base of docker containers
     <em>
      from
     </em>
     which everything starts to
     <em>
      form
     </em>
     . They are very similar to default operating-system disk images which are used to run applications on servers or desktop computers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having these images (e.g. Ubuntu base) allow seamless portability across systems. They make a solid, consistent and dependable base with everything that is needed to run the applications. When everything is self-contained and the risk of system-level updates or modifications are eliminated, the container becomes immune to external exposures which could put it out of order -
     <em>
      preventing the dependency hell
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     As more layers (tools, applications etc.) are added on top of the base, new images can be formed by
     <em>
      committing
     </em>
     these changes. When a new container gets created from a saved (i.e. committed) image, things continue from where they left off. And the
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS">
      <strong>
       union file system
      </strong>
     </a>
     , brings all the layers together as a single entity when you work with a container.
    </p>
    <p>
     These base images can be explicitly stated when working with the
     <strong>
      docker CLI
     </strong>
     to directly create a new container or they might be specified inside a
     <strong>
      <em>
       Dockerfile
      </em>
     </strong>
     for automated image building.
    </p>
    <h3 id="dockerfiles">
     Dockerfiles
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Dockerfiles
     </strong>
     are scripts containing a successive series of instructions, directions, and commands which are to be executed to form a new docker image. Each command executed translates to a new layer of the onion, forming the end product. They basically replace the process of doing everything manually and repeatedly. When a
     <strong>
      Dockerfile
     </strong>
     is finished executing, you end up having formed an image, which then you use to start (i.e. create) a new container.

    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D </code></pre>
    <p>
     Add the docker repository to Apt sources:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list </code></pre>
    <p>
     Update the repository with the new addition:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo apt-get update </code></pre>
    <p>
     Finally, download and install docker:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo apt-get install docker-engine </code></pre>
    <p>
     Ubuntu’s default firewall (UFW: Uncomplicated Firewall) denies all forwarding traffic by default, which is needed by docker.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enable forwarding with UFW:
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit UFW configuration using the nano text editor.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo nano /etc/default/ufw </code></pre>
    <p>
     Scroll down and find the line beginning with DEFAULT
     <em>
      FORWARD
     </em>
     POLICY.
    </p>
    <p>
     Replace:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="DROP" </code></pre>
    <p>
     With:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT" </code></pre>
    <p>
     Press CTRL+X and approve with Y to save and close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, reload the UFW:

     How To Use Docker
    </h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Once you have docker installed, its intuitive usage experience makes it very easy to work with. By now, you shall have the docker daemon running in the background. If not, use the following command to run the docker daemon.
    </p>
    <p>
     To run the docker daemon:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo docker -d &amp; </code></pre>
    <p>
     Usage Syntax:
    </p>
    <p>
     Using docker (via CLI) consists of passing it a chain of options and commands followed by arguments. Please note that docker needs sudo privileges in order to work.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo docker [option] [command] [arguments] </code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Note:
     </strong>
     Below instructions and explanations are provided to be used as a guide and to give you an overall idea of using and working with docker. The best way to get familiar with it is practice on a new VPS. Do not be afraid of breaking anything– in fact, do break things! With docker, you can save your progress and continue from there very easily.

     Let’s begin with seeing all available commands docker have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ask docker for a list of all available commands:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo docker </code></pre>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      All currently (as of 0.7.1) available commands:

     Working with Images
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     As we have discussed at length, the key to start working with any docker container is using images. There are many freely available images shared across
     <strong>
      docker image index
     </strong>
     and the
     <strong>
      CLI
     </strong>
     allows simple access to query the image repository and to download new ones.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      When you are ready, you can also share your image there as well. See the section on “push” further down for details.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Searching for a docker image:*
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker search [image name] sudo docker search ubuntu </code></pre>
    <p>
     This will provide you a
     <em>
      very long
     </em>
     list of all available images matching the query:
     <strong>
      Ubuntu
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Downloading (PULLing) an image:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Either when you are building / creating a container or before you do, you will need to have an image present at the host machine where the containers will exist. In order to download images (perhaps following “search”) you can execute
     <strong>
      pull
     </strong>
     to get one.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker pull [image name] sudo docker pull ubuntu </code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Listing images:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     All the images on your system, including the ones you have created by committing (see below for details), can be listed using “images”. This provides a full list of all available ones.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Example: sudo docker images sudo docker images  REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE my_img              latest              72461793563e        36 seconds ago      128 MB ubuntu              12.04               8dbd9e392a96        8 months ago        128 MB ubuntu              latest              8dbd9e392a96        8 months ago        128 MB ubuntu              precise             8dbd9e392a96        8 months ago        128 MB ubuntu              12.10               b750fe79269d        8 months ago        175.3 MB ubuntu              quantal             b750fe79269d        8 months ago        175.3 MB </code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Committing changes to an image:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     As you work with a container and continue to perform actions on it (e.g. download and install software, configure files etc.), to have it keep its state, you need to “commit”. Committing makes sure that everything continues from where they left next time you use one (i.e. an image).
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker commit [container ID] [image name] sudo docker commit 8dbd9e392a96 my_img </code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Sharing (PUSHing) images:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Although it is a bit early at this moment -
     <em>
      in our article
     </em>
     , when you have created your own container which you would like to share with the rest of the world, you can use push to have
     <strong>
      <em>
       your
      </em>
     </strong>
     image listed in the index where everybody can download and use.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Please remember to “commit” all your changes.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker push [username/image name] sudo docker push my_username/my_first_image </code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Note:
     </strong>
     You need to sign-up at
     <a href="https://index.docker.io/">
      index.docker.io
     </a>
     to push images to docker index.
    </p>
    <h3 id="working-with-containers">
     Working with Containers
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     When you “run” any process using an image, in return, you will have a container. When the process is
     <strong>
      not
     </strong>
     actively running, this container will be a
     <strong>
      <em>
       non-running
      </em>
     </strong>
     container. Nonetheless, all of them will reside on your system until you remove them via
     <strong>
      rm
     </strong>
     command.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Listing all current containers:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     By default, you can use the following to list all
     <strong>
      running
     </strong>
     containers:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo docker ps </code></pre>
    <p>
     To have a list of both
     <strong>
      running
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      non-running
     </strong>
     ones, use:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code>sudo docker ps -l </code></pre>
    <h3 id="creating-a-new-container">
     Creating a New Container
    </h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It is currently not possible to create a container without running anything (i.e. commands). To create a new container, you need to use a base image and specify a command to run.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker run [image name] [command to run] sudo docker run my_img echo "hello"  # To name a container instead of having long IDs # Usage: sudo docker run -name [name] [image name] [comm.] sudo docker run -name my_cont_1 my_img echo "hello" </code></pre>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      This will output “hello” and you will be right back where you were. (i.e. your host’s shell)
     </p>
     <p>
      As you can not change the command you run after having created a container (hence specifying one during “creation”), it is common practice to use process managers and even custom launch scripts to be able to execute different commands.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Running a container:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     When you create a container and it stops (either due to its process ending or you stopping it explicitly), you can use “run” to get the container working again with the same command used to create it.
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker run [container ID] sudo docker run c629b7d70666 </code></pre>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Remember how to find the containers? See above section for
      <em>
       list
      </em>
      ing them.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Stopping a container:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     To stop a container’s process from running:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker stop [container ID] sudo docker stop c629b7d70666 </code></pre>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Saving (
      <em>
       commit
      </em>
      ting) a container:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you would like to save the progress and changes you made with a container, you can use “commit” as explained above to save it as an
     <strong>
      image
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      This command turns your container to an
      <strong>
       <em>
        image
       </em>
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Remember that with docker, commits are cheap. Do not hesitate to use them to create images to save your progress with a
     <br/>
     container or to roll back when you need (e.g. like snapshots in time).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Removing / Deleting a container:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Using the ID of a container, you can delete one with
     <strong>
      rm
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <pre class="code-pre"><code># Usage: sudo docker rm [container ID] sudo docker rm c629b7d70666 </code></pre>
    <p>
     You can learn more about Docker by reading their
     <a href="http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/">
      official documentation
     </a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Remember:
      </strong>
      Things are progressing very fast at docker. The momentum powered by the community is amazing and many large companies try to join in offering support. However, the product is still not labeled as
      <strong>
       <em>
        production ready
       </em>
      </strong>
      , hence not recommended to be 100% trusted with mission critical deployments -
      <strong>
       <em>
        yet
       </em>
      </strong>
      . Be sure to check releases as they come out and continue keeping on top of all things docker.
